# 📑 Digital Transformation Document Comparison Tool (Prototype)

🚀 In an effort to keep pace with digital transformation initiatives, this system was developed to compare different versions of a digital transformation document. The tool leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **transformer-based models** to identify semantic differences and additions between documents.

> ⚡️ Designed to spot meaningful changes beyond superficial differences—offering a smarter way to track updates in regulatory and strategic documents.
